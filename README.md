-LifeTracker-

==============================

LifeTracker is an easy way to store important information and keep it well organized. With LifeTracker, you can create several categories, such as Academics, E-mails, Events, etc. which you can use to store records pertaining to those categories. 

In order to create a new category, simply press F2 to add a record. If you type in a new name in the Category section, then the next time you view the main screen, it will have that category added to the list. If a category does not have any records in it, then the category will delete itself. 

Categories are sorted in alphabetical order, while records are sorted based on preference. Records can either be sorted by date, or alphabetically. You can press F6 to toggle between the two options. 

If you can't find a record that you are looking for, you can press F7 to search for it. Type in a key word or phrase in the search, and press F7 again in order to see results. In order to exit the results, just move the cursor back into the category section.

When adding, deleting, or editting a record, you will be given the option to discard or save your changes. In the case of deleting, you will be sent to a second screen to finalize your decision, just in case you accidentally press the delete key.

Once you are done using LifeTracker, you can press F9 to exit.
